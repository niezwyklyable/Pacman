# Pacman
A very popular 2D game in pygame module but for the first time using a spritesheet instead of individual graphics. Again, I applied an AI but this time I implemented the A* path finding algorithm instead of machine learning stuff. Inheritence, git and commentary were used.

Requirements: pygame

To run the game write in cmd: python main.py
